This document describes the procedure to perform an upgrade on the axum-processes-rack.
You can logon to the system local or from remote (ssh).

- SSH can be used from linux or with the Windows program PuTTY.

When made a ssh connection you can logon using the following information:
user: root
pass: axum

Now you will see the prompt '#' where you can type commands.

First we will try to free as much diskspace as possible:

We clean the package history of unused packages:
  # pacman -Sc

With the command 'df' we check if we have less than 90% of space.
  # df

Check the Use% for /dev/sda1 in the printed result of 'df', here as example:
  Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
  /dev/sda1              1011992    752308    208680  79% /
  none                    111796         0    111796   0% /dev/shm

If there is more space used you may:
1) remove 'log-files' if you don't required them at this moment, and check df again.
  # rm /var/log/*
2) remove the older version from the installed packages:
  # pacman -Scc

Now you should have enough space to start the upgrade which can be done by using
a tarball (is a linux compressed-file) or via the dnr-package-server. 
This upgrade may take several minutes (up to 15 minutes)!

1) using the tarball:
  # pacman -U axum-processes-rack-git-8-i686.pkg.tar.gz
  # pacman -U axum-website-rack-git-7-i686.pkg.tar.gz

2) using the server:
  # pacman -Syu

after this upgrade can free more diskspace by using the following commands:

  # pacman -R qt-dnr-widgets qt-dnr libjpeg libpng
  # pacman -Sc

Now the upgrade is finished!
